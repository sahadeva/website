      <h1>Hi, I'm Sahadeva "Saha" Hammari, a designer living in New York City.</h1>
      <p>I am currently the design director of <a href="https://casetext.com">Casetext</a>, a fast-growing YC startup using artificial intelligence and design to make the law accessible and affordable to everyone.</p>
      <p>Previously I co-founded and led design at two startups. CollabFinder was trusted by Google, The City of New York, UC Berkeley, the Open Data Institute and many others to create truly collaborative communities online. Rumplo was the largest T-shirt marketplace on the web and was recognized for its pioneering design by prominent publications around the world.</p>
      <p>I have spoken about design and culture at conferences and festivals around the world. </p>
